# 🍌 Banana Leaf Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting diseases in banana leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It classifies images of banana leaves into healthy or diseased categories using deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Image classification using CNN
- Preprocessing with OpenCV and Keras utilities
- Trained model saving and loading
- Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation
- Optional web interface using Flask (upload leaf image and get prediction)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask (optional, for web deployment)

## 📁 Dataset

Images of banana leaves categorized into:
- Healthy
- Sigatoka
- Panama Disease
- Other common diseases
